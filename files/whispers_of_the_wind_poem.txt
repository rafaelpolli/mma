**Whispers of the Wind**

In twilight's hush, the day's last light
Fades softly, yielding to the night.
A gentle breeze begins to wind,
The whispers of the wind, we find.

It rustles through the leaves of trees,
A secret keeper, if you please.
Each gust a tale from lands afar,
Where dreams and memories often spar.

With playful force, it picks up pace,
A swirling, twirling, wild embrace.
It dances over hill and dale,
A lively, unrestrained gale.

It strokes the brook, the field, the flower,
A touch of calm, a silent power.
In nature's choir, a soft refrain,
A melody in nature's vein.

But hushed tones grow to urgent cries,
A symphony beneath the skies.
From whispers to a mighty roar,
The wind commands, it does implore.

Yet all too soon, it must recede,
Its voice a memory, a deed.
The silence lingers in its wake,
A quietude for solace's sake.

And though the wind has flown away,
Its echo in our hearts will stay.
A final thought it leaves behind,
The gentle whispers of the wind.
