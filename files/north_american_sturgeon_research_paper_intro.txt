**Introduction**

Sturgeons are among the most primitive of the bony fishes, belonging to the family Acipenseridae, and are renowned for their remarkable evolutionary history that dates back to the Late Cretaceous period. The North American continent is home to several species of sturgeon, each exhibiting unique taxonomic characteristics that have been a subject of extensive scientific inquiry. This paper focuses on the notable species inhabiting North American waters: the Atlantic sturgeon (*Acipenser oxyrinchus*), the Shortnose sturgeon (*Acipenser brevirostrum*), and the White sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*).

Sturgeon species have been pivotal to our understanding of vertebrate evolution due to their status as living fossils. They provide crucial insights into the morphological and physiological adaptations that have occurred over millions of years. The evolutionary significance of sturgeons is further underscored by their unique anatomical features, such as the heterocercal tail, rows of bony scutes, and their elongated, vacuum-like snout. These characteristics not only distinguish them from other fish species but also serve as living representations of a lineage that has persisted relatively unchanged over vast geological timescales.

The introductory section of this research paper will lay the groundwork for a comprehensive exploration of North American sturgeon species, their physical attributes, habitats, behaviors, and the urgent conservation challenges they face. It aims to provide a baseline understanding of the sturgeon's role in the aquatic ecosystem and its importance to biodiversity conservation efforts. The ensuing sections will delve deeper into the fascinating aspects of these ancient fish, highlighting the imperative to protect them and the scientific endeavors aimed at ensuring their survival for future generations.
